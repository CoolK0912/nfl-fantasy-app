## Algorithms Explained

### Team Rating System
Evaluates fantasy teams across multiple dimensions:
- **Position Strength**: Weighted by starter importance
- **Depth**: Quality bench players
- **Upside**: High-ceiling potential
- **Overall**: Composite score (0-100 scale)

### Trade Analyzer
Calculates fair value using:
- Projected fantasy points
- Position scarcity multipliers
- Recent performance trends
- Impact on roster construction

### Game Predictions
Uses ELO-based ratings with:
- Win percentage component
- Point differential analysis
- Strength of schedule adjustments
- Home field advantage (3 points)

### Playoff Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation running 1000+ iterations:
- Probability-based game outcomes
- Seeding based on records and tiebreakers
- Conference championship paths
- Super Bowl matchup prediction
